- Network timeout scenarios

### 5. **Integration Points** (Lines 3400-3416, 3587-3595)
- Home Assistant service calls
- Entity registry interactions
- Device registry management

## Recommendations for Further Improvement

### Short Term (Easy Wins)
1. **Mock Integration Points**: Create tests for HA service calls and entity interactions
2. **Error Path Testing**: Add tests for exception handling and error recovery
3. **Edge Case Coverage**: Test boundary conditions and invalid inputs

### Medium Term (Moderate Effort)
1. **State Machine Testing**: Create comprehensive state transition tests
2. **Power Algorithm Testing**: Test complex power distribution scenarios
3. **Multi-Charger Scenarios**: Test coordination between multiple chargers

### Long Term (Complex Testing)
1. **Hardware Integration Testing**: Mock hardware responses and test communication
2. **Performance Testing**: Test behavior under load and timing constraints
3. **End-to-End Scenarios**: Test complete charge cycles and car interactions

## Test Quality Improvements Needed

### 1. **Async Test Handling**
- Fix pytest async warnings by using proper `@pytest.mark.asyncio` decorators
- Ensure all async methods are properly awaited

### 2. **Property Mocking**
- Improve mocking strategy for read-only properties
- Use property setters where available or alternative approaches

### 3. **Integration Test Improvements**
- Better mock setup for Home Assistant components
- More realistic device registry and entity registry mocks

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impact
- **Significant Coverage Increase**: 5-12 percentage point improvement
- **Core Functionality Covered**: Most essential methods now tested
- **Regression Prevention**: Basic functionality changes will be caught
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as usage examples

### Areas for Continued Work
- **Complex Algorithms**: Advanced power management still needs coverage
- **Integration Testing**: HA-specific functionality needs more thorough testing
- **Edge Cases**: Error conditions and boundary cases need attention

## Conclusion

The test coverage improvement from 28% to 33-40% represents substantial progress in testing the `charger.py` file. The new test suite provides:

1. **Solid Foundation**: Core classes and methods are well-tested
2. **Regression Protection**: Basic functionality changes will be detected
3. **Code Documentation**: Tests demonstrate proper usage patterns
4. **Quality Assurance**: Critical paths through the code are validated

While significant work remains to achieve comprehensive coverage, this improvement establishes a strong testing foundation that can be incrementally expanded.
