"""QS-204 AC4 — JS smoke test for the radiator-card flame redesign.

The radiator card's flame backdrop used to share its sine-wave-tongue
shape with ``qs-pool-card.js``'s water waves, which made the radiator
look like greyed water (idle) or warm-tinted water (running) rather
than flames.

QS-204 replaces the sine-wave path generator with a piecewise-quadratic
peaked-teeth path generator, and removes the global ``translateX``
horizontal scroll in favour of per-tooth tip-flicker. This file
pins the structural markers of that redesign:

* the new path-generator identifier is present;
* ``LAYER_BASE_HEIGHTS`` has a back-layer value ≥ 100 px so the back
  flame reaches roughly half the clip radius;
* idle frames are motionless — either ``STILL_AMP`` is ≤ 0.5 OR the
  card declares a ``STATIC_PEAK_HEIGHT`` constant ≥ 30 px so the idle
  silhouette still shows visible peaks without animation;
* the original palette tables (``FLAME_FILLS`` / ``FLAME_GREY_FILLS``)
  are still referenced (no accidental palette deletion).

JS test harness intentionally omitted — the project has no Jest /
Playwright config. String-grep on the source file is the only
mechanical option, and the actual visual outcome is validated by the
user during PR review (per the project's "JS-card visual review"
workflow).
